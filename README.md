# Running-YOLOv5n-on-an-ESP32-S3

<p>SynapEdge is a compiler that transforms ONNX models into C code, allowing deployment on any microcontroller without complex dependencies or hardware-specific requirements. This project showcases SynapEdge's capabilities by running the YOLOv5 object detection model on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, demonstrating its ability to compile sophisticated AI models for resource-limited edge devices. Although this YOLOv5 implementation isnâ€™t real-time, SynapEdge supports a wide variety of ONNX models as long as the operators are compatible (check updates) enabling real-time applications like MNIST classification, pattern detection in sensor data (e.g., accelerometers and gyros), and crop health monitoring. This versatility opens up numerous possibilities for edge AI solutions.</p>
